**Topic:** {topic}

**Background:** {background_info}

**Board Discussion:**

**Tim Cook (Operations & Technology):**
"From an operational standpoint, we need to think about scalability and long-term sustainability. My key questions: How does this decision affect your operational efficiency? What technology infrastructure will you need? And most importantly, how does this align with your core values as an organization?"

**Warren Buffett (Investment & Strategy):**
"Now, let me ask you the simple questions that matter: Does this make your business stronger or weaker? Can you explain why this is a good use of capital in simple terms? And would you be comfortable holding this position for 10 years? If you can't answer these clearly, you might want to reconsider."

**Maya Angelou (Leadership & Culture):**
"What story does this decision tell about who you are as a leader? Remember, your choices ripple outward and affect everyone who depends on you. Are you making this decision from a place of authenticity and care for your people? The technical details matter, but the human impact matters more."

**Jamie Dimon (Financial Risk):**
"Let's talk about what could go wrong. What's your stress case scenario? How much capital do you need if everything hits the fan? I've seen too many good companies fail because they didn't prepare for the downside. Show me your risk management framework."

**Charlie Munger (Decision Architecture):**
"Invert the problem. Instead of asking why this will work, ask why it will fail. What cognitive biases might be affecting your judgment? Are you using multiple mental models to analyze this, or are you stuck in one way of thinking? The biggest mistakes come from not thinking through second-order effects."

**Art Gensler (Design & Culture):**
"How will this decision affect the human experience for your customers, employees, and stakeholders? Good strategy starts with understanding what people actually need, not what you think they need. What would the ideal outcome look like from a human perspective, and how do you design your approach to create that experience?"

---

**Board Consensus:**
Based on this discussion, the board recommends:
1. Clearly define your success metrics and risk parameters
2. Ensure the decision aligns with your core values and long-term vision  
3. Build in feedback loops and adjustment mechanisms
4. Consider the human impact of your decisions
5. Prepare for multiple scenarios, especially stress cases

**Next Steps:**
Come back with more specific details for deeper analysis, or consult individual board members for specialized expertise.
