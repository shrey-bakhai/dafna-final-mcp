Based on my experience and philosophy, here's how I'd approach this:

**Key Questions to Consider:**
- What are the fundamental drivers of success here?
- How does this align with your long-term vision and values?
- What are the potential risks and how can you mitigate them?

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Focus on the core fundamentals that will drive lasting value
2. Build systems and processes that can scale sustainably  
3. Consider multiple scenarios and prepare for different outcomes
4. Don't neglect the human elements - culture and people matter
5. Measure what matters and track your progress consistently

**Red Flags to Watch:**
Be wary of decisions driven by short-term pressures rather than sound strategic thinking.

**Next Steps:**
- Define clear success metrics
- Identify key assumptions and test them
- Build in regular review and adjustment processes

**Board Discussion:**

**Tim Cook (Operations):** "We need to think about scalability and operational efficiency. How does this decision impact your core processes and values? What systems will you need to support this long-term?"

**Warren Buffett (Strategy):** "Let's focus on the fundamentals. Does this make your business stronger or weaker? Can you explain the value creation in simple terms? Would you be comfortable with this decision for the next 10 years?"

**Maya Angelou (Leadership):** "What story does this decision tell about your leadership? How will this impact the people who depend on you? Are you making this choice from a place of authenticity and care?"

**Jamie Dimon (Risk Management):** "What could go wrong here? What's your downside scenario and are you prepared for it? Show me your risk management framework and capital requirements."

**Charlie Munger (Decision Framework):** "Let's invert this problem. Why might this fail? What cognitive biases might be affecting your thinking? Are you considering second and third-order effects?"

**Art Gensler (Culture & Design):** "How will this affect the human experience for your customers and employees? What would the ideal outcome look like from a people perspective? How do you design for positive culture and experience?"

---

**Board Consensus:**
1. Ensure strong operational foundations and systems
2. Verify the business fundamentals and value creation story
3. Consider the human and cultural impact
4. Prepare for multiple scenarios including stress cases
5. Build in measurement and feedback mechanisms
